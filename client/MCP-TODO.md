MCP TODO:
- when trying to step forward to the end of file (no Qed), the response doesn't terminate (I think?)
- No feedback on errors, when doing interpret to end (or on all the commands?)
- add a uri argument to interpret* commands, so that it doesn't just work on the current file (not sure about this one. Maybe optional uri at most.)
- interpret to point can hang (possibly for non existing points)
